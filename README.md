# Crypto Cipher Collection
An interactive suite of classic cryptographic ciphers, showcasing various encryption techniques used throughout history. This collection includes both substitution and transposition methods, offering hands-on implementations for better understanding.

Substitution Ciphers 

Caesar Cipher – A simple substitution cipher that shifts letters in the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.

Vigenère Cipher – A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a repeating keyword to shift letters dynamically.

Playfair Cipher – A digraphic substitution cipher utilizing a 5x5 matrix to encrypt letter pairs, enhancing security over simple substitution.

Atbash Cipher – A straightforward substitution cipher that reverses the alphabet (A ↔ Z, B ↔ Y, etc.).

Monoalphabetic Cipher – A custom substitution cipher that maps letters to unique replacements in a predefined system.

Transposition Ciphers

Rail Fence Cipher – A transposition cipher that arranges letters in a zigzag pattern before reading them row-wise.

Transposition Cipher – A general technique where letters of a message are systematically rearranged to obscure the original text.

This collection provides an interactive exploration of cryptographic principles, allowing users to experiment with encoding and decoding messages using these classic methods.
